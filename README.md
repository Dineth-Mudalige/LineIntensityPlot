# Line Intensity Profile

This is a custom extension developed for Slicer to get the intensity profile of a line drawn on an image.  
This can compare the two intensities of two images across the lines using a plot.  
To verify the operation of the extension **Reload and Test** button can be pressed.  
Then, the following happens.

In this scenario, sample images will be automatically downloaded.  
The user can draw a line on the image with the ruler and select it as the ruler.  
A different intensity profile can be obtained in relation to the line drawn.  
## Operation

Other images can be loaded into slicer using File >> Add Data and the necessary volumes can be selected from the drop down menu.
